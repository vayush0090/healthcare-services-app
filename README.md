# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- Add a new service.
- Update existing service details.
- Delete a service from the list.

## Technologies Used
- React.js
- Basic CSS

## Instructions to Run

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone "https://github.com/vayush0090/healthcare-services-app"
cd healthcare-services-app

### 2. Install dependencies

When you create a React project (or clone/download one from GitHub), there are certain packages and libraries that the project depends on. These dependencies are listed in a file called package.json.

Installing dependencies means downloading and installing these packages so that the project can run properly.

How to Install Dependencies:
1. Ensure Node.js and npm Are Installed
First, make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. To check, open a terminal/command prompt and run:
bash
Copy code
node -v
npm -v
If you don't have them installed, download and install Node.js from here.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Open the terminal (or command prompt) and navigate to the folder where your React project is located. You can use the cd (change directory) command:

3. Run the npm install Command

npm install

This command reads the package.json file in your project and installs all the required dependencies listed under the "dependencies" section.

4. Verify the node_modules Folder

-After running npm install, a folder called node_modules will be created in your project directory. This folder contains all the libraries and packages your project needs.

What Happens After Installing Dependencies:

-npm install automatically installs the necessary packages (like React, ReactDOM, etc.) for your project to run.

-If someone clones your project from GitHub or downloads it as a zip, they need to run npm install to get all the dependencies locally.

Important:

-This step is necessary before running the app (using npm start).

-Every time the package.json file changes (e.g., adding new packages), you need to run npm install again to update the node_modules folder.

After Installation:
3. Start the application
-Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the project using:
npm run dev

The app will run on http://localhost:3000.


Deployment
The app is deployed on .
